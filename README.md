# research-dev-challenge - a developer challenge for the research team

This challenge is being used by the research team to evaluate candidates.  It is derived from angular-seed 
[https://github.com/angular/angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).

## Getting Started

To get started simply clone the research-dev-challenge repository and install the dependencies:

### Clone research-dev-challenge

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/angiesmith1/research-dev-challenge.git
cd research-dev-challenge
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
angular-seed changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  app.min.css           --> default stylesheet
  components/           --> all app specific modules
    version/              --> version related components
      version.js                 --> version module declaration and basic "version" value service
      version_test.js            --> "version" value service tests
      version-directive.js       --> custom directive that returns the current app version
      version-directive_test.js  --> version directive tests
      interpolate-filter.js      --> custom interpolation filter
      interpolate-filter_test.js --> interpolate filter tests
  integers/                --> the integers view template and logic
    integers.html            --> the partial template
    integers.js              --> the controller logic
    integers_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
  index-async.html      --> just like index.html, but loads js files asynchronously
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
```

### Running Unit Tests

The unit tests are written in [Jasmine][jasmine], which we run with the [Karma Test Runner][karma]. We provide a
 Karma configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* the unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and are named as `..._test.js`.

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and
watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit.  This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected.  The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
npm run test-single-run
```
